# rw-torpedo
Torpedo job for QB-Core 

Call with the burnerphone and get a sms, press accept and you get a location where you can meet a ped that "owes" money. 
Once you have downed the ped you will get money, original you get `svartepenger`, but you can change this to whatever you like in `server.lua`.

Call again and repeat. There are multiple locations and peds in the config file (feel free to change).
There is also a line that makes some of the peds that you encounter that have weapons.

You need to add a item for the phone itself in shared for this useable item `burnertelefon`.

Good luck.
